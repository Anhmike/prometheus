My Investing Laws
Keep a long term horizon (at least a 10 yrs)
risky assets will generally tend to stay risky
down side risk is a better risk measure than MVO
the order of assets classes ranked by long term return will generally stay constant
use a long term rolling return to estimate the expected risk and return of an asset class

Current Rates
3M T-Bill*: 	5.08
Prime: 		8.25
My Savings: 	5.05
* = Yield

Things to research
MAR = max(Inflation,T-Bill)
Downside Risk
Downside Deviation
Upside Potential
Sortino Ratio
Upside Potential Ratio
Excess Omega Return

Scenario (see The Upside of Downside Risk)
beating the benchmark --> risk of active return
beating a set MAR --> risk of portfolio

Steps
generate list of desired asset classes
triage list into minimum investable amount required
test asset class inclusion by calculating rolling covariance matrices
download monthly historical data for all asset classes
set constraints and upper/lower limits for each asset class
use DOX to set up a testing scenarios
bootstrap data to generate a continuous distribution function
calculate pdf and use this equation to calculate downside deviation
calculate sortino ratio, U-P, information ratio, and other risk measures
follow DOX protocol to find refined allocation model 
repeate for each triage
automate caculation to require least effort for regenerating allocation model
Calculate VaR
Utilize Hedging strategy
Calculate my Omega Excess return on Stocks vs. Dow
Figure out a way to measure and compare the return of my entire portfolio
use this to predict if my stock strategy is working

Hedging 
set VaR triggers to identify when further analysis needs to take place
perform scenario testing, stress testing, monte carlo simulation, bootstrapping procedures to identify largest risk areas
use options to limit the worst case senarios suscecptible to itentified risk areas
