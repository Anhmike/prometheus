My Investing Laws
Keep a long term horizon (at least a 10 yrs)
risky assets will generally tend to stay risky
down side risk is a better risk measure than MVO
the order of assets classes ranked by long term return will generally stay constant
use a long term rolling return to estimate the expected risk and return of an asset class

Current Rates
3M T-Bill*: 	5.08
Prime: 		8.25
My Savings: 	5.05
* = Yield

Things to research
MAR = max(Inflation,T-Bill)
Downside Risk
Downside Deviation
Upside Potential
Sortino Ratio
Upside Potential Ratio
Excess Omega Return

Scenario (see The Upside of Downside Risk)
beating the benchmark --> risk of active return
beating a set MAR --> risk of portfolio

Portfolio Grader Steps
Calculate XIRR
bootstrap data to generate a continuous distribution function for each portfolio
calculate pdf and use this equation to calculate downside deviation of portfolio
calculate sortino ratio, U-P, information ratio, and other risk measures of portfolio
Calculate VaR
Calculate my Omega Excess return on Stocks vs. Dow
Figure out a way to measure and compare the return of my entire portfolio
use this to predict if my stock strategy is working
random portfolios
differentiate passive (buy and hold) vs active (transactions match personal portfolio) benchmarks

Allocreator Steps
calculate max number of asset classes budget can handle
update historical data for all asset classes
generate list of asset classes to include by calculating rolling covariance matrices
set constraints and upper/lower limits for each asset class
use DOX to set up testing scenarios (fake portfolios)
follow DOX protocol to find refined allocation model 
automate calculation to require least effort for regenerating allocation model

Hedging 
set VaR triggers to identify when further analysis needs to take place
perform scenario testing, stress testing, monte carlo simulation, bootstrapping procedures to identify largest risk areas
use options to limit the worst case senarios suscecptible to itentified risk areas
